## Project Background

Kafburg Fintech Plc is experiencing operational challenges: transaction failures, fraud detection and blokage, 5G Network premium package impact and budget
optimization. Thebproject analyzes available hospital data and produces an interactive excel dashboard with actionable recommendation.



## Project Objective

-Identify root causes of transaction failures, sustem security lapses, network premium impact and resource optimization.
-Analyze success and failure distribution based on location, device type, time of transaction, latency, transactiona type etc.
The network premium impact, cybersecurity efficiency, investment focus.
-Build an interactive Excel dashboard to inform board leve decisions.
-Recommend prioritized actions to stabilize banks operations


## Dataset

** transaction_dataset.xlsx ** - transaction_id, transaction_type, transaction_status, geolocation, device_used, latency, slice_bandwidth.


## Dashboard Features

- Key KPIs: total transactions
- Visuals: Success/Failure distribution based on time, geolocation, transaction type, latency group, device used, slice bandwidth, charts.
- Interactivity: slicers/Filters for transactionntype, device used, transaction status.


  ## Finding

  - High success rate that indicates the transaction failure is not majorly due to bank system failure nor network failure
  -  No high failure in a specific transaction type, geolocation, device used, slice bandwidth, latency group, and all the factors considered.
  -  Failure is almost evenly distributed on device used, transactin types, geolocation, latency group, slice bandwidth group
  -  The system cybersecurity system is not tight enough to stop transactions markrd as 'Fraud flag'.
  -  At low Latency, there is still high failure.
  -  Network slice premium has no impact on operation efficiency.


    ## Recommendations

  1. The fintech's backend system need to be upgraded.
  2. Cybersecurity systen of the bank need to be upgraded and tightened with most modern and advanced tools and technologies to stop transactions marked as
     'Fraud flag' from goimg through.
  3. the App development resources has to be equally assigned to Desktop and Mobile app development.
  4. The Fintech app has to be constantly upgraded to infuse recent technologies and security measures.
  5. The Fintech should look for another Network provider with better services.
  6. Customers should be encouraged to regularly update their app when such pops up on their app for better features and enhanced efficiency.
 

  ## Tools and Techniques

  - Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tabl, Pivot Chart, Slicers)
  - Data cleaning and transformation in Excel
  - Dashboard layout and visualization best practices.

  - 'README.md'- this document
 

  ## How to Run/View

  1. Open 'dashboard.xlsx' in Excel (desktop recommendation)
  2. enable content (if prompted) to allow Pivot table and slicers to Work.
  3. Use slicers to filter by Device type, Transaction type etc.
  4. Refer to 'Presentation.pdf' for a summary of insights and recommended actions.
